#Numerical/quantitative data - can take a wide range of numerical values. can be continuous or discrete. Visualized using the histogram 
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 200)
# always explore with different width intervals using the binwidth argument which is measured in the units of x variables 
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000) # too large resulting in data bein binned into 3 bars
# alternative visualization plot is density plot which is a smooth out version of histogram. Normally used for a continuous data that comes from an underlying normal smooth distribution

```{r}
# Visualizing relationships: numercal and categorical variables 
#To visualize the relationship between a numerical and a categorical variable we can use side-by-side box plots
# box that indicates the range of the middle half of the data, a distance known as the interquartile range (IQR), stretching from the 25th percentile of the distribution to the 75th percentile. 
#In the middle of the box is a line that displays the median, i.e. 50th percentile, of the distribution. These three lines give you a sense of the spread of the distribution and whether or not the distribution is symmetric about the median or skewed to one side.
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_boxplot()
# Alternatively, we can make density plots with geom_density()
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_density(linewidth = 0.75) # customized using the linewidth argument to make them stand out
# we can also use the color and fill arguments with alpha aes (values btwn 0 - 1, )
